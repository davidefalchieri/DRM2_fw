ALICE TOF firmware:
-------------------

- the firmware manages HBr

- the firmware manages both triggered and continuous runs (SOT-EOT, SOC-EOC)
	- SOT-EOT: only physics triggers are accepted
	- SOC-EOC: only special TOF-triggers are accepted
	
- the firmware manages RT_TT (run_type) and RS_TT (running_state) bits:
	- if the board wakes up in the middle of a run, but RS_TT = 1, then:
		- if RT_TT = 0, the board begins working in triggered mode
		- if RT_TT = 1, the board begins working in continuous mode
