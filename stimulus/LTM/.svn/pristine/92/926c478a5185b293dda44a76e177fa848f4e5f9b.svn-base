Info: Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time
Info: Device migration not selected. If you intend to use device migration later, you may need to change the pin assignments as they may be incompatible with other devices
    Info: Device EP1C4F400C6 is compatible
Info: Fitter converted 1 user pins into dedicated programming pins
    Info: Pin ~CRC_ERROR~ is reserved at location C2
Warning: No exact pin location assignment(s) for 5 pins of 279 total pins
